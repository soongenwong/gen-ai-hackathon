Here’s an updated 6-hour sprint plan that incorporates your vendored SDV code, with clear ownership, timeboxes, and Git branches for each feature.

### Branching Strategy

* **`main`**: Production-ready code (what you’ll deploy and submit).
* **`develop`**: Integration branch where all feature work is merged for final QA.
* **`feature/*`**: Short-lived branches for each major piece:

  * `feature/sdv-initial` – vendor SDV install & repo setup
  * `feature/sdv-core` – SDV metadata detection & sampling
  * `feature/error-handling` – robustness
  * `feature/download-and-styling` – CSV download & UI polish
  * `feature/validation` – input checks
  * `feature/privacy-slider` – bonus privacy knob
  * `feature/deployment` – deployment configuration

### Communication & Git Best Practices

* Commit early, push often to your feature branch.
* At each sync point, PR your feature branch into `develop` for a quick review.
* Once all features are merged into `develop` and tested, merge `develop` → `main`, deploy `main`, and grab your public URL.

With this plan you’ll cover core functionality, error handling, UI polish, and deployment—all within 6 hours and with clear ownership. Good luck!
